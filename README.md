# MOODify

MOODify is a Java console application that provides mood-based music and podcast recommendations. Built on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, its core purpose is to demonstrate practical applications of inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in a real-world simulation.

# OVERVIEW

- [Abstraction](#abstraction)
- [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)
- [Inheritance](#inheritance)
- [Polymorphism](#polymorphism)

### IMPLEMENTATION
Abstraction - AudioContent abstract class defining common structure and play() behavior

Encapsulation - Private attributes with getters & setters in classes like AudioContent, Music, and Podcast

Inheritance - Music and Podcast classes extend AudioContent

Polymorphism - Overridden play() method behaves differently for Music and Podcast
